##Biography
I am a Double Major Criminal Justice/Computer Forensics student studying at Sierra College and CSU Sacramento.
My professional goal is to receive my Bachelor's Degree, obtain a GCFE Certification, and be commissioned into the United States Coast Guard.
My IT experience comes from my time volunteering aboard the Battleship IOWA Museum in the Port of Los Angeles, where I assisted in the development of the shipboard network infrastructure.

I live in Meadow Vista, CA with my wife, and enjoy working on construction and landscape projects in my spare time.
I am also a student pilot, and will be attempting my final practical examination soon!

##How many computers are in the classroom?

Assuming that 'Computer' is defined as a physical device possessing a CPU, memory, and an operating system, there are an estimated 64 computers in the classroom. 
This number is derived from the 32 desktops, an estimated 1 cell phone per 26 occupants, and an estimated 6 personal laptops carried by students.

I chose to use the computer in Hanger F at the Auburn Municipal Airport. This machine is a Dell Inspiron laptop running Windows 7 Professional.

The primary users of this PC are the pilots who own the hangar. They are all current or former airline pilots who are accustomed to interacting with technology.
The PC is primarily used for flight planning, maintenance logging, and time tracking, and requires the ability to run fairly substantial charting programs such as ForeFlight.

The machine's technical specifications are as follows:

- Processor - Intel Core i5
- Storage   - 1TB SSD
- Memory    - 4 GB
- Graphics  - DirectX 10

These all exceed the hardware requirements for Windows 10, which are as follows:
    Processor - 1 GHz or Faster
    Storage   - 16 GB Free Space
    Memory    - 1 GB (2 GB for x64)
    Graphics  - DirectX 9

I would upgrade this machine using an in-place upgrade. I would choose this option due to the large number of important spreadsheets and other files (>500 GB) that are on the local machine's SSD. The effort required to transfer those files to another storage location, then to reimport them once a clean install was completed, makes an in-place upgrade the most logical option. Additionally, as this PC is not used for personal computing, the amount of bloatware present is limited. I did not use any Microsoft tools to make this determination.

I would likely choose to install Windows 10 Professional on this PC, as some of the documents contain information regarding financial partnerships that would be better secured with the added features included in the Professional version of the OS.

##Since We Last Met - Recent Technology News 

BBC posted an article today detailing the extradition of Russian citizen Andrei Tyurin to the United States on federal hacking charges.
This incident is notable for its rarity, as foreign nationals have historically been safe from extradition on charges such as these. 
The crimes Tyurin is being charged with relate to the 2014 security breach of several major banks, principally J.P. Morgan Chase, resulting in the the personal information of nearly 80 Million Americans being compromised. 
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman stated that the extradition represented a "Significant Milestone" in the legal fight against international cyber crime.

##Windows 10 Virtualized Operating System

On September 24, 2018, Microsoft announced what it's calling the Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD). WVD will allow users to virtualize Windows 7 and 10, Office 365 ProPlus apps and other third-party applications by running them remotely in Azure virtual machines
Using WVD, customers will be able to provide remote desktop sessions with multiple users logged into the same Windows 10 or Windows Server virtual machine. They also can opt to virtualize the full desktop or individual Microsoft Store and/or line-of-business applications. The WVD service also supports full VDI with Windows 10 and Windows 7, Microsoft officials told Ars Technica. (Those wanting to virtualize Windows 7 after Microsoft support ends in January 2020 will be able to do so for three years without paying for Extended Security Updates.)
Licenses for WVD will be provided for no additional cost as part of Windows Enterprise and Education E3 and E5 subscriptions. The aforementioned Windows 10 Enterprise for Virtual Desktops edition won't be released as a separate version of Windows 10 at all.

##What is UAC?

According to Microsoft.com, User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature of Windows which helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system. These changes can be initiated by applications, users, viruses or other forms of malware. User Account Control makes sure certain changes are made only with approval from the administrator. If the changes are not approved by the administrator, they are not executed, and Windows remains unchanged. It is as if nothing happened. UAC was first made available for Windows Vista, and since then it was improved with each new version of Windows.

Due to the apparent configuration of the Sierra College domain account, the user experience in regards to UAC is nearly identical on the Host and Virtual machines.

###Software Bugs

**What is a software bug?**

    The term "Bug" as used in reference to a software issue is generally credited to US Navy RADM Grace Hopper, a pioneer Computer Scientist working with the Harvard Mk II computer.
    RADM Hopper was investigating a malfunction with the computer's systems when she discovered that they were the result of a moth who had caused a short in the electrical system.

    Today , a software bug refers an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

**Windows 10 1809 Build Software Bug**

    The following is an excerpt from Microsoft's statement regarding the major bug found in Windows 10 1809 Build:

    The Windows 10 October 2018 Update was made available last Tuesday and was due to begin rolling out automatically from tomorrow. However, on Saturday, Microsoft announced it had "paused" the rollout, removing the ability for general users to receive the update manually.
    Microsoft's decision is in response to a growing number of complaints from users who say the update deleted files in their user Documents and Photos folders — in some instances resulting in the loss of many thousands of files dating back years.
    At present there is no indication as to when the rollout of the update will continue, with Microsoft simply stating: "We will provide  an update when we resume rolling out the Windows 10 October 2018 Update to customers".

You have a new desktop running Windows 10. However, you try to copy your file repository and find out that you do not have enough disk space. 
You have 400 GB of free disk space on your C drive and you have 3 smaller 500 GB drives. What can you do?

In this scenario, I would make use of the Storage Spaces tool to create a larger Virtual Drive from the four smaller physical drives. Microsoft provides the following steps to implement this solution:
- Add or connect the drives that you want to group together with Storage Spaces.
- Go to the taskbar, type Storage Spaces in the search box, and select Storage Spaces from the list of search results.
- Select Create a new pool and storage space.
- Select the drives you want to add to the new storage space, and then select Create pool.
- Give the drive a name and letter, and then choose a layout. Two-way mirror, Three-way mirror, and Parity can help protect the files in the storage space from drive failure.
- Enter the maximum size the storage space can reach, and then select Create storage space. 

You create a new storage pool for the following disks on your Windows 10 computer:
- Serial ATA (SATA): 1 TB
- Serial Attached SCSI (SAS): 1 TB
SATA and SAS are two different types of drives with different connectors/interfaces.
What is the maximum size you can allocate for your new storage space?

A 1 TB SATA Drive can be used to create a storage capacity of up to 2 TB.
A 1 TB SCSI Drive can also be used to create a storage capacity of up to 2 TB.
Therefore, by combining the two together using Storage Spaces, we can create a storage space with a maximum size of 4 TB.

According to the Microsoft Support Website, you can use Group Policy to distribute computer programs by using the following methods:

**Assigning Software:**

You can assign a program distribution to users or computers. If you assign the program to a user, it is installed when the user logs on to the computer. When the user first runs the program, the installation is completed. If you assign the program to a computer, it is installed when the computer starts, and it is available to all users who log on to the computer. When a user first runs the program, the installation is completed.

**Publishing Software**

You can publish a program distribution to users. When the user logs on to the computer, the published program is displayed in the Add or Remove Programs dialog box, and it can be installed from there.

In light of this information, I would use GPOs to push the appropriate software to each user group, assigning the required software packages and publishing the optional software packages for selective installation.

**NetLab 7 Questions:**

What is the most likely reason that Remote Desktop is unable to connect to the remote computer?

- As we can verify that the remote computer is powered on, and is connected to the network, the most likely reason that the connection attempt failed is that remote access to the computer is not enabled.

After the Remote Desktop successfully connects, what is displayed on the top of the
screen that identifies PC1 is being used?

- The remote computer's IP Address

While remotely connected to PC1, click on the Start Menu and select the Power icon.
What option(s) is listed there at this time?

- Disconnect

Why is it necessary to login to the PC1 machine again when accessing it locally?

- As Windows cannot support multiple simultaneous users like UNIX, the Local User is signed out when the Remote User connects to the computer.

Is the file created by PC2 on the desktop?

- Yes

What are some benefits of using the Remote Desktop Connection?

- It allows support technicians or administrators to access and troubleshoot or configure a computer without having to be physically present at that computer's location.


**Additional Questions**

Joe is a new IT Director who is tasked with making sure his Windows 10 computer users can be assisted remotely. On his first day at the company, Joe was told that the Remote Assistance feature was not working for users after a new firewall was installed. What could be causing the problem and how should it be addressed?

- The Network Administrators who installed and configured the new firewall likely chose to block TCP Port 3389, the port generally used for RDP Access, to prevent unauthorized computers from connecting remotely and compromising company assets. Joe needs to create a firewall exception for packets from authorized Remote Assistance machines to be allowed through Port 3389 or a custom RDP Port.

You are an administrator at the Contoso Corporation. You have a 12-person help desk that supports about 10,000 users spread out over a 5-building campus. You don’t have enough people to provide support staff visits to a user who is having problems. Describe the actions you can take to support your company users.

- You can use Remote Assistance so that your support staff can connect to a computer remotely and can interact with the user's session. To use Remote Assistance, users will call the help desk. The Help Desk can then walk a user through in creating an invitation, to be sent to the user via email. After getting the password from the user, you can connect to the user's session and help the user.

**Additional Questions**

You are an IT manager and would like to use a virtual machine to keep up to date on the latest development in Windows 10 and access the preview builds.  How would you go about doing this?

- According to Microsoft, you can run Insider Preview builds as a virtual machine in Hyper-V. This option enables you to run Insider Preview builds without changing the Windows 10 production build already running on a PC.

As an IT manager, one of the departments you support is Physical Plant Operations.  They use a specialized application to run power generators that does not need access to the Internet or require any operating software updates.  Which branch of Windows 10 will you recommend for use by the Physical Plant Operations department?  Why?

- I would recommend using Windows 10 IoT for this implementation. According to Microsoft, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is a full version of Windows 10 that delivers enterprise manageability and security to IoT solutions. Windows 10 IoT Enterprise shares all the benefits of the world-wide Windows ecosystem. It is a binary equivalent to Windows 10 Enterprise, so you can use the same familiar development and management tools as client PCs and laptops.

As an IT manager, you have developed a custom image of Windows 10 that is deployed to all general users.  You do not want the users to be able to install additional software, including applications found in the Windows Store.  How could you prevent users from installing apps from the Windows Store?

- I would accomplish this using the Windows AppLocker feature. Windows AppLocker was introduced in Windows 7 and includes some new features in Windows 8/10. With AppLocker, an administrator can block or allow certain users or user groups from installing or using certain applications using blacklisting or whitelisting rules.

**Scenario**

You are an IT manager and several computers belonging to support staff were recently upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise.  You have received several complaints that "their computers are slow", "apps stop responding" and "websites are slow to load".  Describe the monitoring tools you would use to help diagnose the issues.

**Response**

I would employ the Process Monitor tool to identify possible sources for these issues. Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such session IDs and user names, reliable process information, and simultaneous logging to a file.

I would also use the Task Manager tool to evaluate the general performance of the system, check for disk or memory thrashing, isolate over-consumptive processes, or identify and upgrade inadequate system resources.
